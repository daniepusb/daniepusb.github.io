    <h2 id="thesis-research-topic-sept-2008---sept-2009">Thesis Research Topic (sept 2008 - sept 2009)</h2>

    <p>The research work for my bachelor degree consists of the development of an adaptive videogame environment that adjusts based on the user temperance.</p>

    <p>The videogame turns more violent when the user tends to apply a more violent strategy. In the same manner, the videogame 
    adjusts to passive player moves by reducing the level of dynamism and violence. At the end the different type of users are 
    questioned to determine if this adaptive strategy makes the game more appealing to their preference. The project obtained 
    an Exceptionally Good Mention.</p>
